#🩺 Healthcare Data Analysis – Diabetes Prediction & Pattern Discovery
This project explores a real-world healthcare dataset focused on diabetes diagnosis. Using Python and data analysis libraries like Pandas, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn, the project identifies patterns, correlations, and risk factors associated with diabetes. The goal is to uncover meaningful insights for preventive healthcare and build a basic predictive model to classify diabetes outcomes.

#📌 Key Objectives
Analyze patient health metrics to identify trends linked to diabetes

Visualize feature relationships (e.g., glucose, BMI, age)

Discover age-wise prevalence patterns

Build a basic machine learning model to predict diabetes risk

#🔧 Tools & Technologies
Python

Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation

Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization

Scikit-learn for classification model and evaluation

📊 Dataset
Source: diabetes.csv

Features: Glucose, Blood Pressure, Insulin, BMI, Age, etc.

Target: Outcome (1 = diabetes, 0 = no diabetes)

🔍 Project Highlights
Cleaned and preprocessed healthcare data

Correlation heatmap and outcome-based feature distributions

Age group-based diabetes rate analysis

Random Forest Classifier for disease prediction

Feature importance ranking to identify critical health factors
